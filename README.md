The project has been developed for the IBM Hack Challenge 2020.
1. Our project is a responsive cross-browser web application to predict weekly sales for perishable goods.

2. Data entered by the user and will be stored for future references and for training the model to make accurate predictions.

3. Considering fields (features) in the historical data entered by the warehouse manager, we can predict the quantity of products to be ordered in the future for the warehouse.

The web app will also present the statistics obtained after analysing the data in the form of charts for better visualisation. 

Dependencies:
1. Install Python 3
2. Install Django 
3. Install PostgreSQL
4. Install suitable editor

To run the app, simply open the django>warehouseManagement folder in the terminal/command prompt and type the following command:
python manage.py runserver
This should start the server on localhost:8000

In case of problems you may need to make migrations for django.
